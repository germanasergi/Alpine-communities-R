# Alpine-communities-R

This repository containes materials for statistical computing and graphics to study an ecology dataset of Alpine plants. The objective is to test different statistical approaches to link plant traits, habitat variation and community structure in Alpine landscapes. 
In particular, it focuses on relating the species’ traits to the sites distribution and assessing plant trait response to the snow melt environmental variable.

## Project overview

Habitat heterogeneity has allowed, throughout the evolution, to forge plant strategies and species’ functional traits as a result of a long-term history of adaptation.
This means that the habitat template is a filter able to sort species according to their particular combination of traits. In particular, snow cover is a multifaceted ecological factor that significantly influences 
the life history, physiology, and distribution of alpine plants. We prove that there exists important relationships between plant traits and snow cover distribution.

## Methods

Several methods are tested:
- Hellinger distance matrix
- Ward’s minimum variance
- Classification tree
- Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
- Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA)
- NMDS
